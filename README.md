This repository is made for SabancÄ± University course CS412 2024 fall semester project by Alper Arda OLGUN
This project involves text classification and regression using social media data. It preprocesses text data by normalizing and cleaning captions, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains a LightGBM classifier to predict user categories. For regression, the model predicts average post like counts based on historical data and profile features. The methodology includes effective text preprocessing, stratified data splitting, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance. Outputs include classification results (user-category mappings) and regression predictions (average like counts) in JSON format. The project achieved high classification accuracy and reasonable regression performance, with room for improvement through advanced feature engineering and modeling techniques.
